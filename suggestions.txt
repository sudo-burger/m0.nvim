1. Error handling and user
feedback:
   - Improve error handling by providing more informative error messages to the
     user.
   - Display a status message or indicator when the plugin is waiting for a
     response from the AI backend.
   - Implement a timeout mechanism to handle cases where the API request takes
     too long or fails silently.

2. Asynchronous API calls:
   - Convert the `run` function in the backend object to use asynchronous API
     calls instead of blocking the editor while waiting for the response.
   - Use Neovim's built-in `jobstart` or `libuv` library to make asynchronous
     HTTP requests.
   - Update the `M0chat` function to handle the asynchronous nature of the API
     calls and display the response when it arrives.

3. Conversation history and persistence:
   - Implement a mechanism to store conversation history across sessions.
   - Introduce a new command or function to start a new conversation or
     continue an existing one.
   - Store conversation history in a separate file or database, allowing users
     to review and resume previous conversations.
   - Provide commands to browse, search, and manage conversation history.

Additionally, here are a few minor improvements:

- Add support for more AI backends by extending the `make_backend` function and
  providing corresponding configuration options.
- Implement command completion for `M0prompt` and `M0backend` commands based on
  the available prompts and backends in the configuration.
- Allow users to customize the section mark used to separate user and assistant
  messages in the conversation.
- Provide options to configure the display format of the conversation in the
  buffer (e.g., indentation, text wrapping).
- Add documentation and help files for the plugin, explaining its usage,
  configuration options, and available commands.

These improvements focus on enhancing the user experience, handling errors
gracefully, improving performance through asynchronous calls, and providing
conversation persistence and management features. =====
